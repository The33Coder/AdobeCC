# AdobeCC
This script install AdobeCC from the dmg.
The dmg is dowloading from https://helpx.adobe.com/download-install/kb/creative-cloud-desktop-app-download.html

_Note_ :
On dec, Adobe now has a single version for Intel and ARM. The verification of the OS type does not make sense anymore

The pkg is created with Composer. For more informaions https://docs.jamf.com/composer/10.28.0/user-guide/Package_Building.html
Packages is also a solution. http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/documentation/Packages/en_2017/index.html
